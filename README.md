🎬 Hybrid Movie Recommender System
This project is a hybrid movie recommender system that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations.

🔍 Features
Content-Based Filtering: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on their plot and metadata.

Collaborative Filtering: Implements Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to learn from user ratings and preferences.

Hybrid Approach: Merges both techniques to improve accuracy and overcome individual limitations.

Scalable Backend: Efficiently handles large datasets for real-time recommendations.

UI Development (In Progress): A user-friendly interface is under development to enable interactive recommendations.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise (for SVD)

Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation

Flask (planned) for API integration with the frontend
